# Bring Your Own Blocks

![Theme screenshot image](screenshot.png?raw=true "Theme Screenshot")

BYOB is an opinionated WordPress theme that gets rid of anything unnecessary for a headless WordPress site.

This theme was made for headless sites where editors don't need control of the design. Only the Classic/Freeform block is enabled. Bring your own blocks by [writing your own custom Gutenberg blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/writing-your-first-block-type/) or by [creating ACF Gutenberg blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/).

WordPress core blocks are far too complicated for headless websites. Do your clients really need the option to modify line height or text and background colors? You can disable some of these options but others are extremely hard to remove. The UX of the Gutenberg editor is already confusing enough, why litter it with options that you don't even support on your frontend? Or why spend time supporting these options when editors shouldn't have that much control in the first place? Designers should be responsible for designing the site, not editors!
