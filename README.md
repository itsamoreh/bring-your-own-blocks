# Bring Your Own Blocks

![Theme screenshot image](screenshot.png?raw=true "Theme Screenshot")

A simple WordPress theme for sites where editors don't need control of the design. Only the Classic/Freeform block is enabled. Bring your own blocks by [writing your own custom Gutenberg blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/writing-your-first-block-type/) or by [creating ACF Gutenberg blocks](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/).

WordPress core blocks are too complicated. If you're a full service agency and you're developing a site from a design, do your clients really need the option to modify line height or text and background colors? You can disable some of these options but others are extremely hard to remove. The UX of the Gutenberg editor is already confusing enough, why litter it with options that you don't even support in your theme? Or why spend time supporting these options when editors shouldn't have that much control in the first place? Designers should be responsible for designing the site, not editors!
